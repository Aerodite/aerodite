Hello, I'm Anthony, I do schoolwork and code sometimes. Current High School Sophomore.
I'm pretty ok(ish) at making websites, I'm trying to get better at C++ and JS, but I need more projects to do ðŸ˜ž

Things I use:

M1 Pro MacBook Pro 14' (base binned model, 8/14 cpu/gpu, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd)

JetBrains Rider EAP (C++ and Python)

JetBrains Webstorm (HTML and CSS)

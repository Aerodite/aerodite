Hello, I'm Anthony, I do code and schoolwork sometimes, considering im a sophomore in high school (as of now);
I'm pretty ok(ish) at making websites, I'm trying to get better at Python and C++, but I need more projects to do ðŸ˜ž

Things I use{

M1 Pro MacBook Pro 14' (base binned model, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd)

JetBrains Rider EAP (C++ and Python)

JetBrains Webstorm (HTML and CSS)
}

redbull is pretty goated
